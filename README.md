# **Sleep Dues Proposal**

How many hours of sleep did you get last night? What about the night before? And the night before that? It's important to track the amount of hours of sleep we're getting at night because it can have significant implications on not only our own health, but also the safety and well-being of everyone else around us. Keep track of your sleep debt and the consequences of it with Sleep Dues. The phrase "I'll sleep when I'm dead" couldn't be more misleading.
